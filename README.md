# Pizza Menu

This is a simple React.js project that displays a pizza menu. The project demonstrates the use of React components, props, and conditional rendering.

## Components

### `App`

The main component that renders the entire application. It includes the `Header`, `Menu`, and `Footer` components.

### `Header`

A simple header component that displays the title of the pizza restaurant.

### `Menu`

This component displays the list of pizzas available. It uses the `Pizza` component to render each pizza item. If there are no pizzas available, it shows a message indicating that the menu is still being worked on.

### `Pizza`

This component displays the details of a single pizza, including its name, ingredients, and price. If the pizza is sold out, it shows a "Sold Out" message.

### `Footer`

The footer component displays the opening hours of the restaurant. It shows whether the restaurant is currently open or closed based on the current time.
